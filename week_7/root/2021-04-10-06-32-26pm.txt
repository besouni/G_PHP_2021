Create The HTML Form

Some rules to follow for the HTML form above:
Make sure that the form uses method="post"
The form also needs the following attribute: enctype="multipart/form-data". It specifies which content-type to use when submitting the form
Without the requirements above, the file upload will not work.
Other things to notice.

However, with ease comes danger, so always be careful when allowing file uploads!
